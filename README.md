# üöÄ 60 Days of Learning (2025 Edition)

Welcome to my #60DaysOfLearning2025 challenge!  
This repository is a personal learning log where I document my daily progress as I explore and upskill in various areas of technology.

## üìÖ Start Date:
June 1, 2025

## üéØ Goal:
To stay consistent with learning and build hands-on skills in areas like:
- Big Data (Hadoop, HDFS, Hive, PySpark etc.)
- Data Engineering
- Linux & Shell Scripting
- SQL
- Cloud Fundamentals (AWS/GCP)
- Tools & Frameworks I encounter during my journey

## üìö Daily Logs
Each day I will:
- Practice or learn something new
- Document the learnings in a markdown file (e.g., `Day01.md`)
- Push relevant screenshots, notes, or code snippets
- Share highlights on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) using hashtags like `#60DaysOfLearning2025`

## üîñ Progress
I will update this section weekly with my learning summary.

| Day | Topic | Summary |
|-----|-------|---------|

| 03 | Hadoop Architecture | Studied YARN, HDFS structure and node responsibilities |
| 04 | Practicing HDFS | Created/uploaded/viewed files in HDFS, practiced `put`, `cat`, `ls` |
| 05 | Practicing HDFS | Created & viewed sample.txt with  HDFS cmds: put, ls, mkdir, get, cat, tail|
| 06 | Read an article | A Comparative Evaluation of Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark|
| 07 | Read multiple article | On big Data Concepts and Analytics|
| 08 | Watched HDFS tutorial in YT | To stregthen my knowledge in HDFS before umping into Mapreduce|
| 09 | Learnt about MapReduce | Read about MapReduce from  youtube tutorials and also implemented it's various usecases in my vm terinal|
| 10 | Read about hive | Read about Hive, it's archiecture, how it works|
| 11 | Installed Hive | Installed Apache Hive on my VM today as I dive deeper into the Big Data ecosystem |
| 12 | Namenode not working | Tried to fix namenode error issue, but couldn't solve it today |
| 13 | Read article | Read article on Case Study of Hive using Hadoop |
| 14 | Read SQL | Basic Terms and Table and Column Naming Rules |
| 15 | Read about SQL keys |Read about foreign, unique and primary keys in detail and made notes in notepad|
| 16 | Read about SQL check and default costraint | Learned about DEFAULT AND CHECK CONSTRAINT in sql and made notes in notepad |
| 17 | Practiced SQL queries | Revised and used some sql functions i hadn't used in a while |
| 18 | Practiced sql queries | Practiced easy to medium SQL queries |
| 19 | Read a research paper | Read a paper on expanding SQL learning beyond RDBMS to Big Data systems like MapReduce, NoSQL & NewSQL. Essential shift for modern data insights. |
| 20 | Read sql quizes | Practiced sql quizes trough learn sql app |
| 21 | Read sql functions | Revised aggregate, string, numeric, date functions today |
| 22 |Fixed HDFS issue |Spent the day fixing an HDFS issue caused by inconsistent NameNode/DataNode directories. Solved it by reformatting NameNode and clearing stale PID files |
| 23 | Practice queries in hive | Created a Hive database lspp23, a sales table, inserted rows, and wrote SQL queries to view sales, calculate revenue, analyze orders by region, and filter data by conditions like product type and quantity.|
| 24 | Installed spark and lerned queries |Installed Apache Spark 3.5.6 and ran my first RDD queries using sc.parallelize() and groupBy. Learned how Spark handles distributed data and transformations across nodes.|
| 25 | Practiced sql queries | Practiced medium hard SQL queries and revised my notes from previous days |
| 26 | Learned about pysaprk | Learning in detail about PySpark from datacamp course 'Introduction to PySpark DataFrames |
| 27 | Learned SQL Window fuctions| Learned about window functions , bit hard compared to other sql topics but an informative read |
| 28 | Hard level SQL Queies |Did some hard level SQL questions today, focusing on advanced CASE WHEN, subqueries, and grouping logic. Feeling more confident with daily practice. |
| 29 | Data Wareshouse |Studied Data Warehousing today: its need, components, types, characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Learned how it helps store huge data centrally for analysis and better decision-making. |
| 30 | Hard level SQL queries| Practiced hard SQL today with CASE WHEN, MOD for even-odd, JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, LAG window functions, ROUND, and ORDER BY custom sorting. These are levelling up my SQL skills.|
