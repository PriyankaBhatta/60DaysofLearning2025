# 🚀 60 Days of Learning (2025 Edition)

Welcome to my #60DaysOfLearning2025 challenge!  
This repository is a personal learning log where I document my daily progress as I explore and upskill in various areas of technology.

## 📅 Start Date:
JUne 1, 2025

## 🎯 Goal:
To stay consistent with learning and build hands-on skills in areas like:
- Big Data (Hadoop, HDFS, Hive, etc.)
- Data Engineering
- Linux & Shell Scripting
- SQL
- Cloud Fundamentals (AWS/GCP)
- Tools & Frameworks I encounter during my journey

## 📚 Daily Logs
Each day I will:
- Practice or learn something new
- Document the learnings in a markdown file (e.g., `Day01.md`)
- Push relevant screenshots, notes, or code snippets
- Share highlights on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) using hashtags like `#60DaysOfLearning2025`

## 🔖 Progress
